# 🚀 ReportRack – Power BI Portfolio Sharing Redefined

**Your Power BI dashboards deserve the spotlight, not a corporate firewall.**  
ReportRack is a React-based platform purpose-built for students, aspiring analysts, and data enthusiasts to **host and share Power BI dashboards**—without enterprise email, paid plans, or technical barriers.

## 🌟 Why ReportRack?

Power BI’s embedding tools are powerful… but not student-friendly.  
You either need a paid license or an enterprise email to embed dashboards—leaving students and independent creators stuck with screenshots or screen shares.  
That’s where **ReportRack** comes in: an open platform that acts as your personal **Power BI portfolio**—live, accessible, and sharable.
